So to run the program you should simply write "gcc Homework7" then you will get the executable which is a.out. After that write "./a.out" and it will run the program. At first you will be asked to write the number of processes. After enterin the number of the processes you will be asked to enter arrival time and burst time for process as many times as you chose the number of processes. You should have some prompt like this "Enter the arrival time and burst time for process 1:" and for this you need to enter the two values seperated with space, meaning "0 8" and say you enter the number of processes n, you will be prompted to write arrival time and burst time n times. After successfuly inputing all the required values, you will get the outputsof FCFS and SJF exactly like in the moodle sample.
